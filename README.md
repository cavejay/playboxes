Dots & Dashes X-DREEM
======

Libraries to test:
- http://paperjs.org/
- https://two.js.org/
- http://anime-js.com
- http://snapsvg.io/docs/
- http://fabricjs.com/
- https://p5js.org


We need to check both paper.js, phaser.js and pixi.js to see how compatable they are with what we want to do. They need these features:
  - Easily paint dots and lines in grid
  - Dots/lines on hover/mouse-over
  - Dots/lines on click event
  - pan
  - zoom 
  - Squares when all 4 lines are filled.
  
  Perhaps play a small 9 square game.


FYI
------------

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
